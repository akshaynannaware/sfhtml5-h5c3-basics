# HTML5/CSS3 (and Javascript) Basics
[Richard Clark](mailto:rdclark@nextquestion.net), [Head of Training](mailto:training@kaazing.com), [Kaazing](http://www.kaazing.com)

## Why this class?

HTML5 and CSS3 have changed the world of web development. We've had plenty of new people come to the SFHTML5 Meetup who
would benefit from a quick intro, and there are plenty of people who need to pick up modern web development.

## Objective

When you're done with this day, you should be able to look at a page's source and understand it, then be able to
extract pieces and/or make changes. You should also be able to build straightforward pages of your own. You won't be an
expert, but will have a good foundation to build on as you read other tutorials and attend future meetups.

## Why are the examples so simple?

We'll probably build extra examples during the workshop (depending on the needs of the attendees.) These will go into
the github repository after.

## A note to people not at the workshop

The PDF of the slides is here, but the most important part of the workshop comes from discussions, doing the labs, and
seeing live examples. I apologze if you expected to get a lot from the slides; that *might* work for conference talks
but the real learning comes from interacting with the skills you're learning and/or testing your assumptions with
someone who knows.

Kindly let the meetup group know if you would like another one of these workshops and/or possibly recordings. The free
[Intel AppUp Screencast Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL81FA83F3A4266BBA) covers much of the same
ground (and I recorded them for Intel), though parts are a bit dated now.
